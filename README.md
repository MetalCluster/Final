A text adventure game made in python
You operate this game by choosing a letter between a-e or by yes or no to traverse each of the 5 towers if you so choose  
import time is needed 
If I had more time I'd polish the game a bit more and add a life system
I didn't run into any issues and i completed this assignment without the help of a student,tutor or outside sources.
